## How to run this app:

In the project directory run:

### Step 1 - Start the Fronted `npm start`

Run `npm start` in the terminal

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

#### This will start the Frontend part of the app, where you will be able to find a pokémon by its name or id, you can only search by one field at a time.

### Step 2 - Start the Backend `npm start`

 - Open a new terminal in the same directory.
 - Type: `cd server`
 - Then run `npm start`

#### This will start the Backend of the app wich will post the pokemon data to the data base.
**Note: If you only run the Frontend of the app you would get an error every time you search for a pokémon.**
